Now, more than ever before, patients are taking to social media to expand their knowledge on health, share their experiences and build communities. HealtheVoices continues to empower health advocates to use social media effectively, ensuring conversations and timely information is accessible to patients and caregivers in need. Click HERE to register for the next session, where top HCP influencers will focus on the patient story and how HCPs can help elevate their digital voice. As with previous sessions, the agenda is packed with engaging and informative conversations with HCPs and patient advocates, including: Pam Ressler, RN, MS, HNB and Mariah Leach, Rheumatoid Arthritis advocate, on what HCPs can learn from patients through their stories. Aline Charabaty, M.D. and Olivia Fulton, Respiratory advocate, on translating data, using relatable language, and normalizing uncomfortable conversations. Amy Stenehjem, M.D. on living life as both a patient and HCP. And soon-to-be-announced keynote speaker on using social media to serve and connect with patients, in a fireside chat with hosts Brooke Abbott, IBD advocate and Dan Choi, M.D. You can also visit HealtheVoices.com and follow @HealtheVoices on Twitter and Instagram to learn more.

            "A 40-year-old patient presented to the emergency room with painful and itchy skin changes on both lower legs that had been in place for twelve days. Apart from a severe ulcerative colitis known for nine years, which was treated with infliximab (5 mg / kg body weight) at the time of presentation, no previous illnesses were known. The skin changes were first noticed about five weeks after the second infusion. Histologically, there were signs of psoriasis as well as mixed-cell superficial perivascular dermatitis. When viewed together with the clinical picture, psoriasiform dermatitis was diagnosed. With intensified local anti-inflammatory therapy, the skin changes rapidly regressed. Infliximab administration was paused for four weeks and then continued every eight weeks. The skin changes did not reappear. source: Dtsch Arztebl Int 2020; 117: 652; DOI: 10.3238\n",

But, the last sentence give me a pause. https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/915613 Patients with autoimmune disease treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) agents are twice as likely to develop Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) compared with patients not exposed to these agents. \"This analysis is the first study to demonstrate, in a population‐based cohort, that there is an increased risk of the development of de novo inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) among individuals exposed to a specific anti‐TNFα agent utilized to treat other nongastroenterological, rheumatologic conditions,\" write Joshua Korzenik, MD, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, and colleagues. The researchers published their findings online July 2 in Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics . Using data from the nationwide Danish health registry, Korzenik and colleagues identified 17,018 patients with a diagnosis of autoimmune disease for which an anti-TNFα was prescribed between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 2017. The observation period continued for 3 months after the last anti-TNFα injection. They compared these patients with 63,308 patients with autoimmune disease, diagnosed during the same time period, who did not receive anti-TNFα agents. Etanercept , infliximab , and adalimumab were the most common anti-TNFα agents used, and over 50% of patients in the anti-TNFα group were exposed to 2 or more agents during the study period. Korzenik and colleagues found that patients treated with etanercept were twice as likely to be diagnosed with de novo CD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 ‐ 2.8), whereas the aHR for infliximab and adalimumab were 1.3 (95% CI, 0.8 ‐ 2.2) and 1.2 (95% CI, 0.8 ‐ 1.8), respectively. Further, patients treated with etanercept were also found to be twice as likely to be diagnosed with de novo UC (aHR 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5 ‐ 2.8). There w...\n",
